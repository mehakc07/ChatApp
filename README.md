### ChatApp

### Introduction

This is a Realtime Chat application with websockets where multiple users can engage in instant communication within designated rooms. It enables seamless messaging between users in real-time by joining chat rooms.

### Tool Used

I have used Node.js, Express and Socket.io with Vanilla JS on the frontend with a custom UI.

### Usage
```
npm install
npm run dev

Go to localhost:3000

```
